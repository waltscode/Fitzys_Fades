## Overview

Our full-stack application offers a seamless experience for clients and barbers alike. Clients can easily create accounts to schedule appointments with their preferred barber, specifying date and time preferences. Barbers, in turn, can manage both past and future appointments through their own accounts. Additionally, clients have the convenience of sending general inquiries directly to the barber. Powered by React and supported by a GraphQL backend.
